Nhost Authentication is a ready-to-use authentication service that is integrated with the [GraphQL API](/graphql) and its permission system from Hasura. This allows you to easily add user authentication to your application without having to build and maintain your own authentication system.

- [Email and Password](/authentication/sign-in-with-email-and-password)
- [Magic Link](/authentication/sign-in-with-magic-link)
- [Phone Number (SMS)](/authentication/sign-in-with-phone-number-sms)
- [Security Keys (WebAuthn)](/authentication/sign-in-with-phone-number-sms)
- [Apple](/authentication/sign-in-with-apple)
- [Discord](/authentication/sign-in-with-discord)
