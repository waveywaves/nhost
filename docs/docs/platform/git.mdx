Nhost allows you to automatically deploy your Nhost project when you do changes to your Git repository.

## Supported Git Providers

- GitHub

Support GitLab, BitBucket, and other Git providers are on our roadmap.

## Deployment

The following things are deployed:

- Database migrations
- Hasura metadata
- Serverless Functions
- Email Templates

:::caution
Settings in `nhost/config.yaml` are **not** deployed. That means you need to manually sync settings between local and remote environments between the CLI and Nhost Cloud.

## Using GitHub

1. From your Nhost project, click **Connect to Github**.

2. **Install the Nhost project** on your Github account.

## Deployment Branch

Nhost only deploys changes from the **Deployment Branch**. By default, your deployment branch matches the default branch (usually `main`).

You can change the Deployment Branch on the **Git** page in the **Settings** section.

It's possible to have multiple Nhost projects connected to the same Git repository and use different Deployment Branches (e.g., `main` and `staging`). Learn more about [multiple environments](/platform/multiple-environments).

## Base Directory

If your Nhost project is not located at the root of your Git repository, which is typically the case when using a monorepo, it's possible to set a custom Base Directory. The Base Directory is where the `nhost/` directory is located. In other words, the Base Directory is the **parent directory** of the `nhost/` directory.

You can change the Base Directory on the **Git** page in the **Settings** section.
