Environment Variables are key-value pairs configured outside your source code. They are used to store environment-specific values such as API keys.

You can manage your project's Environment Variables in Nhost Dashboard under **Variables**. When you define a new variable, you can set one value for **production** and one for **development**.

Environment Variables are available for:

- [Hasura GraphQL Engine](/graphql)
- [Serverless Functions](/serverless-functions)

When an Environment Variable has updated the changes happen immediately for Hasura GraphQL Engine. For Serverless Functions, a new deployment via [Git](/platform/git) is required.

## System Environment Variables

System Environment Variables are automatically available in production and during local development. The following system Environment Variables are available:

- `NHOST_ADMIN_SECRET`
- `NHOST_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `NHOST_BACKEND_URL` ([deprecated](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/discussions/1319))
- `NHOST_SUBDOMAIN`
- `NHOST_REGION`
- `NHOST_HASURA_URL`
- `NHOST_AUTH_URL`
- `NHOST_GRAPHQL_URL`
- `NHOST_STORAGE_URL`
- `NHOST_FUNCTIONS_URL`
- `NHOST_JWT_SECRET`

Example values:

```text
NHOST_ADMIN_SECRET=e7w36ag287qn5qry795f6ymm57qgvqup

NHOST_WEBHOOK_SECRET=ns3sfjgdw4y6zeqthwnnw347dzh8wyj4

NHOST_BACKEND_URL=https://abc123abc.nhost.run

NHOST_SUBDOMAIN=abv123abc

NHOST_REGION=eu-central-1

NHOST_HASURA_URL=https://abc123abc.hasura.eu-central-1.nhost.run/console

NHOST_AUTH_URL=https://abc123abc.auth.eu-central-1.nhost.run/v1

NHOST_GRAPHQL_URL=https://abc123abc.graphql.eu-central-1.nhost.run/v1

NHOST_STORAGE_URL=https://abc123abc.storage.eu-central-1.nhost.run/v1

NHOST_FUNCTIONS_URL=https://abc123abc.functions.eu-central-1.nhost.run/v1

NHOST_JWT_SECRET={"type": "HS256", "key": "vumpbe2w2mgaqj5yqfp7dvxu6kywtvsgb68ejpdaqxerea8jwrsszdp2dhkjxsh4df69pzm3ja6ukedx8ja43zdt6q9kgbgg2w9vh2sedeppukud9a2qzy29v3afdn7m"}
```

## Development Environment Variables

When developing locally using the [CLI](/cli), Environment Variables set in `.env.development` are available in your local environment. There are two ways to manage them:

1. Edit the `.env.development` file manually.
2. Add development Environment Variables in the Nhost Dashboard and use `nhost env pull` to sync them. This way, your team members will also have access to the same Environment Variables.
