Event Triggers enable you to invoke webhooks when a database event happens. Event Triggers are typically used to do post-processing tasks, using custom backend code, based on database events.

Event Triggers are associated with a specific table in the database and the following event types are available:

- **INSERT** - A row is inserted into a table.
- **UPDATE** - A row is updated in a table.
- **DELETE** - A row is deleted from a table.

:::info

It's currently only possible to create Event Triggers in the Hasura Console. We're working on adding support for creating Event Triggers in the Nhost Dashboard.

### Example Use Case

Let's say you're building an e-commerce application and you want to send an email to the customer when a new order is placed. Orders are stored in the `orders` table in your database.

To send out an email every time a new order is placed, you create an event trigger that listens for the `INSERT` event on the `orders` table. Now every time an order is placed, the event trigger invokes a webhook with the order information, and the webhook sends out the email.

## Create Event Trigger

Event Triggers are managed in the Hasura Console. Select **Events** in the main menu and click **Create** to add an Event Trigger.

## Event Triggers and Serverless Functions

Event Triggers and [Serverless Functions](/serverless-functions) are a perfect combination to build powerful database-backend logic. Every Serverless Function is exposed as an HTTP endpoint and can be used as a webhook for Event Triggers.

### Format

When using Serverless Functions as webhooks you should configure the webhook using a combination of environment variables and endpoints like this:

```
{{NHOST_FUNCTIONS_URL}}/orders-insert-send-email
```

![Webhook URL Format](/img/database/event-triggers/webhook-url-format.png)

The `NHOST_FUNCTIONS_URL` is a [system environment variable](/platform/environment-variables#system-environment-variables) and available in production and in development environments using the [CLI](/cli).

### Security

To make sure incoming requests to your webhook comes from Hasura, and not some malicious third party, you can use a shared webhook secret between Hasura and your webhook handler (e.g. your Serverless Function).

It is recommended to use the `NHOST_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, which is a [system environment variable](/platform/environment-variables#system-environment-variables) and available in production and in development environments using the [CLI](/cli). The `NHOST_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is available both in Hasura and in every Serverless Function.

To set this up is a two-step process:

- Step 1: Add the header `nhost-webhook-secret` with the value `NHOST_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (From env var) when creating the Event Trigger in the Hasura Console.

- Step 2: Check the header `nhost-webhook-secret` for incoming requests and make sure the header is the same as the environment variable `NHOST_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

Here is an example of how to check the header in a Serverless Function:

```js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  // Check header to make sure the request comes from Hasura
  if (req.headers['nhost-webhook-secret'] !== process.env.NHOST_WEBHOOK_SECRET) {
    return res.status(400).send('Incorrect webhook secret')
  }

  // Do something
  // Example:
  // - Send an email
  // - Create a subscription in Stripe
  // - Generate a PDF
  // - Send a message to Slack or Discord
  // - Update some data in the database

  console.log(JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2))

  return res.send('OK')
}
```

The `NHOST_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is a [system environment variable](/platform/environment-variables#system-environment-variables) and available in production and in development environments using the [CLI](/cli).
