Every Nhost project comes with its own [Postgres database](https://postgres.org/). Postgres is the world's most advanced open-source relational database and it's the most [popular SQL database for developers](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-databases).

There are three ways of managing your database:

1. Nhost Database UI (recommended).
2. Hasura Console.
3. [Connect directly to the database.](#postgres-access)

## Schemas

Generally, you should use the `public` schema for your project. It's also ok to add custom schemas for more advanced usage.

The two schemas `auth` and `storage` are reserved for [Nhost Auth](/authentication) and [Nhost Storage](/storage). You're allowed to modify **permissions** and **add relationships**. However, never modify any tables or remove relationships that were added by Nhost inside the `auth` and `storage` schemas.

## Manage Tables

### Create Table

1. Go to **Database** in the left menu.
2. Click **New table**.
3. Enter a **name** for the table.
4. Add **columns**.
5. Select a **Primary Key** (usually the `id` column).
6. (Optional) Select an **Identity** column. Identity is for integer columns only and is usually selected for the `id` column so the `id` is automatically incremented (1,2,3...) on new rows.
7. (Optional) Add **Foreign Keys**.
8. Click **Create**.

When a table is created it is instantly available through the [GraphQL API](/graphql).

Here's an example of how to create a `customers` table:

<Tabs groupId="nhost-vs-sql">
  <TabItem value="nhost" label="Nhost" default>

<video width="99%" autoPlay muted loop controls="true">
  <source src="/videos/nhost-table-create.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sql" label="SQL">

```sql
CREATE TABLE "public"."customers" (
  "id" bigint PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
  "name" text NOT NULL
);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Edit Table

1. Go to the **Database** in the left menu
2. Click on the **context menu** of the table you want to change and click **Edit table**.
3. **Edit** (add, change, delete) the table's columns.
4. Click **Save**.

Here's an example of how to edit a `customers` table by adding an `address` column:

<Tabs groupId="nhost-vs-sql">
  <TabItem value="nhost" label="Nhost" default>

<video width="99%" autoPlay muted loop controls="true">
  <source src="/videos/nhost-table-edit.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sql" label="SQL">

```sql
ALTER TABLE "public"."customers" ADD COLUMN "address" text;
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Delete Table

1. Go to the **Database** in the left menu
2. Click on the **context menu** of the table you want to delete and click **Delete table**.
3. Click **Delete** to confirm deleting the table.

**Example:** Delete a `customers` table:

<Tabs groupId="nhost-vs-sql">
  <TabItem value="nhost" label="Nhost" default>

<video width="99%" autoPlay muted loop controls="true">
  <source src="/videos/nhost-table-delete.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sql" label="SQL">

```sql
DROP TABLE "public"."customers";
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Postgres Access

It's possible to access your Postgres database directly with your favorite Postgres client.

Go to **Settings** in the left menu and click on **Database**. You'll find the connection string and credentials to connect to your database.

### Reset Postgres Password

It's possible to reset the database password under **Settings** -> **Database** -> **Reset Password**.

<video width="99%" autoPlay muted loop controls="true">
  <source src="/videos/nhost-database-reset-password.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

## Migrations

To track database changes, use the [Nhost CLI](/cli) to develop locally and use our [Git integration](/platform/git) to automatically deploy database migrations live.

1. Develop locally using the Nhost CLI.
2. Push changes to GitHub.
3. Nhost automatically deploys changes.

Learn how to do [development with the Nhost CLI](/cli/local-development).

## Seed Data

Seed data is a way of automatically adding data to your database using SQL when a new environment is created. This is, for the moment, only applicable when you're using the [Nhost CLI](/cli) to develop locally. When you're running `nhost up` for the first time, seed data is added.

In the future, seed data will also be added to new preview environments.

Seed data should be located in `nhost/seeds/default/` and are executed in alphabetical order.

**Example:** Two seed scripts with countries and products.

```text
nhost/seeds/default/001-countries.sql
nhost/seeds/default/002-products.sql
```

## Backups

Databases on the [Pro and Enterprise plans](https://nhost.io/pricing) are automatically backed up daily.

## Best Practices

- Use lower-case names for tables. E.g. `customers` instead of `Customers`.
- Use plural names for tables. E.g. `customers` instead of `customer`.
- use underscore (`_`) instead of camelCase for table names. E.g. `customer_invoices` instead of `customerInvoices`.
- use underscore (`_`) instead of camelCase for column names. E.g. `first_name` instead of `firstName`.
